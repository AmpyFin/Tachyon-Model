# Tachyon-Model

> **Open Source Side (OSS)**  
> This is the open source implementation of the Tachyon Model, designed to mirror the functionality of the proprietary version while providing greater customization and transparency. This OSS version allows users to modify, extend, and adapt the model according to their specific needs.

## Overview

The Tachyon Model represents our multi-platform arbitrage system designed to exploit cross-market inefficiencies with remarkable precision. This model simultaneously compares pricing across multiple exchanges and instruments, identifying price discrepancies between different trading venues. Using statistical modeling to account for execution costs, slippage, and latency, the Tachyon Model generates high-probability arbitrage opportunities across asset classes. This model excels in fragmented markets where pricing anomalies between platforms can be capitalized upon for consistent returns.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Platform Arbitrage**: Simultaneously monitors pricing across multiple exchanges and instruments to identify cross-market inefficiencies
- **Statistical Modeling**: Incorporates execution costs, slippage, and latency into decision-making processes for realistic profit calculations
- **Cross-Asset Arbitrage**: Exploits pricing discrepancies across different asset classes and trading venues
- **High-Frequency Detection**: Rapid identification of arbitrage opportunities in fragmented markets
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Balances profit potential against execution risks and market impact
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Continuous monitoring of market conditions for optimal entry and exit timing

## System Architecture

The Tachyon Model operates as a sophisticated arbitrage detection and execution system, leveraging advanced statistical models and real-time data feeds to identify and capitalize on cross-market pricing inefficiencies.

## Purpose

The goal of the Tachyon Model is to move beyond traditional single-market approaches:
- Instead of focusing on single exchange strategies
- Instead of relying on manual arbitrage detection
- Instead of ignoring execution costs and market impact

The model leverages advanced statistical modeling and multi-platform monitoring to identify high-probability arbitrage opportunities while accounting for real-world trading constraints. By simultaneously analyzing pricing across multiple venues and asset classes, the Tachyon Model can capture fleeting arbitrage opportunities that would be impossible to detect through traditional methods.
